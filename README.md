# DeepModelDiver
 
Designed for deep net feature extraction, dimensionality reduction, and benchmarking, this repo contains a number of convenience functions for loading and instrumentalizing a variety of models. Models available include those from:

- the [PyTorch-Image-Models](https://github.com/rwightman/pytorch-image-models) (Timm) library
- the [Torchvision](https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/models.html) model zoo
- the [Taskonomy](http://taskonomy.stanford.edu/) (visual_priors) project

This repository is a work in progress.
